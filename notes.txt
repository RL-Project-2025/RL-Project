Actual Important Notes:
WEEKLY MEETING Fridays 1:15 - RL Lab
We will try to have most of the work done before the end of Week 11 to not have too much of a backlog over the christmas holidays.
IMPORTANT: Every idea/change should be put in the report.docx file

TASK FOR NEXT WEEK MEETING(Week 8):
Have implemented a simple a RL algorithm and have tested it on the gym. (Get familiar with the enviroment, the algorithm isnt too important as long as it is NOT a tabular algorithm!) 

Extra Marks For:
Customised reward function IF the original gym reward function serves inadequate

Little Extra Marks:
Overly customised enviroment

Footnote:
Goodluck gang

For Week 9:
    Use the right env :)
    Read research paper. https://arxiv.org/html/2507.00257v1
MAIN GOAL:    Start thinking about different algorithm approaches. HAVE A SOLID IDEA SET ON WHICH ALGO BY NEXT WEEK.
    Make your own branches.
    Get familiar with HEX.
    Think, Dockers & MLFlow.
    WHAT DOES THIS REWARD FUNCTION MEAN.(Be clear about how the reward is calculated)
    Read the documentation, for reward function, state space, actions avalible/space.
    If you got time, identify differences between models.
    Find out what they use in the industry.
