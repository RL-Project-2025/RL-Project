#Trained A2C for a range of time steps; to get a sense of how performance scales:

A2C: 10k Timesteps
mean_episode_reward: 1343.98358875 
std_episode_reward: 305.1880059662487

A2C: 20k Timesteps
mean_episode_reward: 2208.3451898 
std_episode_reward: 241.1425106843368

A2C: 50k Timesteps --> Performed worse than 10k and 20k ?
mean_episode_reward: 1266.9428258
