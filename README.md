# Water Management - RL Algorithm Testing

Reinforcement Learning project using gym4ReaL.

## Resources

- **Gym Environment**: [gym4ReaL](https://github.com/Daveonwave/gym4ReaL) (WDSEnv)
- **Reference Framework**: [Stable Baselines3](https://share.google/D5U4Vtt1jg7mAxOXD) (For baseline comparisons only)
- **Key Research Paper**: [Arxiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.00257v1)

## Current Task (Week 10)

**Main Goal**: Finalise decision on which algorithm to implement.

## To Do's
- ##### Hulusi
	- [ ] **TUESDAY**: Look into the differences between **Tensor Logs / Weights & Biases / Hugging Face / MLFlow**
	- [ ] Learn **enough** about the State/Action Space
	- [ ] **TUESDAY**: Look into whether an episode is **168** time steps or not **(IT SHOULD BE!)**
	- [ ] **Have** models(zip files for): PPO, A2C, DQN, Recurrent PPO
- ##### Radha
	- [ ] **TUESDAY**: Graphs to visualise performance (Can be seen on page 9 of [Arxiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.00257v1))
	- [ ] **Random** move algorithm as a baseline. Should be something along the lines of `Random baseline = env.action_space.sample() at every step`
	- [ ] **Have** models(zip files for): DQN, PPO+LSTM 
- **Kavish**
	- [ ] **Look into** reward tuning.
	- [ ] Learn **enough** about the State/Action Space
	- [ ] **Have** models(zip files for): DQN, A2C, ARS
- **Amy**
	- [ ] List of things to use as **INDUSTRY STANDARD ALGORITHMS**
	- [ ] **TUESDAY**: Look into the differences between **Tensor Logs / Weights & Biases / Hugging Face / MLFlow**
	- [ ] **Have** models(zip files for): A2C, Maskable PPO
- **Kamal**
	- [ ] **TUESDAY**: Look into the differences between **Tensor Logs / Weights & Biases / Hugging Face / MLFlow**
	- [ ] **Have** models(zip files for): ARS, TRPO
- **Reece**
	- [ ] **TUESDAY**: Look into whether an episode is **168** time steps or not **(IT SHOULD BE!)**
	- [ ] **Have** models(zip files for): QR-DQN, TRPO

## Hopefully Schedule

- [ ] Tuesday **5:30 PM** WILL POST TEAMS LINK
- **Weekly Meetings**: Fridays @ 1:15 PM - RL Lab
- **Documentation**: All ideas and changes must be documented in `report.docx`
- **Target**: Complete most implementation work by end of Week 11 (before Christmas holidays).
- **Mid Week Meeting**: Tuesday **5PM** WILL POST TEAMS LINK

### Footnote
- WE are in no rush, we are ahead of schedule gangsters. If you feel overworked **take a break**, no need to tell anyone we do not care!
