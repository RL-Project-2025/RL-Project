# Water Management - RL Algorithm Testing

Reinforcement Learning project using gym4ReaL.

## Resources

- **Gym Environment**: [gym4ReaL](https://github.com/Daveonwave/gym4ReaL) (WDSEnv)
- **Reference Framework**: [Stable Baselines3](https://share.google/D5U4Vtt1jg7mAxOXD) (For baseline comparisons only)
- **Key Research Paper**: [Arxiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/html/2507.00257v1)

## Current Task (Week 9)

**Main Goal**: Finalise decision on which algorithm to implement.

### To Learn
- **Algorithm Selection**: Have a solid idea set on which algorithm we will implement by next week (Week 10).
- **Reward Function/ State Space/Action Space Analysis**: Be able to clearly define how the reward is calculated. Read documentation for state space and action space limits. **NOTE**: Do start considering changes to the reward function based on what we are planning on implementing.
- **Industry Standard Research**: Research what algorithms are used in the industry for similar management problems.

### To Do
- **Branch Management**: Create individual branches for development; **DO NOT**  push directly to main.
- **Tools**: Learn [**HEX**](https://hex.cs.bath.ac.uk). Start considering **Docker** and **MLFlow** integration.
- **Research**: Read the provided arXiv paper.

### Optional
- Identify differences between various model architectures.

## Hopefully Schedule

- **Weekly Meetings**: Fridays @ 1:15 PM - RL Lab
- **Documentation**: All ideas and changes must be documented in `report.docx`
- **Target**: Complete most implementation work by end of Week 11 (before Christmas holidays).

#### Footnote
-   **Gang**: Goodluck
